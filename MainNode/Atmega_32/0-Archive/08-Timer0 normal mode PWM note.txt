note that you cannot do 100 KHZ 25% duty cycle because the ISR will have two if conditions
:
the full cycle is 1 /100 khz is 10 micro sec
		one to set ctc to catch on 2.5 micro sec (with its suitable number and prescaler)
and
		one to set ctc to catch on 7.5 micro sec

the problem is when it gets inside the isr and sets the ctc to catch at 2.5 ,
the Timer0 register counts to more than 2.5 second before it gets out of the ISR
so it can never be achieved
